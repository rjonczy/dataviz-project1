# Data
Provided data set comes from [NASA](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp).


# Data Visualisation

* Subset of data: Dataset contains observations between 1880-2014, for visualisation following years have been chosen: 1950-1990, for further analysis we will focus on 1960-1980, which were mark as START and STOP date
* X-axis: Year
* Y-axis: Deviations over seasons
    + DJS season: December, January, February
    + MAM season: March, April, May
    + JJA season: June, July, August
    + SON season: September, October, November

# Technology

I have used following R-packages:

* [xts R-package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xts/index.html)
* [dygraphs](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dygraphs/index.html), Demo and short getting-started tutorial can be found [here](http://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/index.html)
